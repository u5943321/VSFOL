# SEAR

“Sets, Elements And Relations”, a structural set theory by Mike Shulman.

Original statements of the theorems are from the [nlab page of SEAR](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/SEAR).

- `SEARpred_set`: elementary set theory in SEAR.
- `SEARNarith`: Natural number arithmetic.
- `SEARZarith`: Integer arithmetic, we prove theorems up to division with reminder.
- `SEARFiniteness`: Finite sets.
- `SEARList`: Lists. We define El, the indexing function, using the same approach as in HOL, and show that we can define functions over lists such as Map using list induction.
- `fm`: modal formulas.
- `SEARUF`: ultrafilters.
- `SEARrecty`: modal logic.
- `SEARllist`: lazy lists. We defined LMap and proved it behaves correctly by corecursion and coinduction.
- `SEARGrp`: group theory, with usual DTT approach.
- `SEARexamplecol`: existence of large sets.
